# bimay-vue
Ayam is an experimental project that allows you to quickly access all your important BINUSMaya data such as schedules and assignments, without hassle. This project started because I am tired of using the official BINUSMaya website because it is too much hassle even just to access my daily schedules 😞, that's even before those dreaded popups came. 🙃

Ayam is built using VueJS and TailwindCSS. Ayam is not based on [Portal](https://github.com/chrsep/Kingfish) but heavily inspired by it. Big thanks to Chrisando Pramudhita ([chrsep](https://github.com/chrsep)) for making such an incredible app! 🎉
